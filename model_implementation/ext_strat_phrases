# Julia's development version of finding stratigraphic entities for global-geologic-units app
# 
# differences from strom app:
# + lots more terms (igneous, metamorphic, etc.)
# + a few new types of entities:
#		= Large Igneous Province (is 'Large' a stop word?)
#		= ** [rock type][NNP][NNP?] (of) [NNP][NNP] (might be rare) e.g. Quartz Monzonite of Ruby Lake
#		= ends in 'Complex'
# 		= anything else?
#
# input flag_words lists:
#	= last word in every Macrostrat strat_name
# 	= every Macrostrat lithology
# 	= extra ones from Brenhin
#	= ?
#
# Input will be a file with each entity separated by a newline:
#		Limestone
#		Formation
#		etc.
#
# two(+?) methods:
#	= similar to strom (will find 'Green River Formation' or 'Big Red Schist')
#		+ find flag_words, read backwards,
#		+ keep same strom rules
#			- (will not find Quartz Monzonite, I don't think -- double flag_word rule)
#	= different to account for Brenhin's example: 'Quartz Monzonite of Ruby Lake'
#		+ is this format always/almost always the same?
#		+ algorithm:
#			- find flag
#			- read backwards through proper nouns before flag
#			- relax rules but keep:
#				1. capitalized first letter
#				2. not a number
#				3. not a stop word
#				4. any others?
#			- read forwards from flag
#			- if it's 'of':
#				look after 'of' -- proper noun(s) = keep
#			- save "...[NNP][NNP] flag 'of' [NNP][NNP]..."
